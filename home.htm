                            <p>Kipp Campbell has taught various levels of special education for over 35 years. She currently teaches Developmental Preschool for the Prosser School District. Throughout her career, Kipp often saw students struggle with reading and writing. But it wasn’t until her own young son was diagnosed with a visual dysfunction that Kipp fully understood about binocular issues and the impact on learning. Her Master’s thesis was based on trying to raise awareness in the schools. Kipp continues to focus on sharing the importance of vision development as an adjunct instructor for Early Childhood classes at Columbia Basin College, student teacher supervisor and  presentor at teacher trainings and parent workshops.</p>

                            <p>
                                Dr. Mary Pellicer is passionately committed to the art of healing. She believes in the possibility of healing--healing no matter what. If you tell her the problem you're having she'll always tell you, "You can heal that". This is definitely a different level of thinking than she learned while earning her medical degree at the University of Washington Medical School.
Dr. Pellicer has a lifelong interest in healing work. Trained as a family practitioner, she worked for a number of years in a community and migrant health clinic practicing conventional allopathic medicine. She also has experience in community work, having served as both medical director of a healthy community project for a large hospital system and as an evaluation consultant for a number of community service programs. 
She now is involved in integrating information and techniques from her explorations on the frontiers of healing, back into the current cultural paradigm and being a bridge between conventional and alternative healing modalities. Mary finds great joy in helping people to heal especially from chronic conditions and has taught hundreds of people to use various self healing techniques with great success.
When Dr. Pellicer became aware of the issue of convergence insufficiency and other binocular dysfunctions, she added that to the list of health problems that she believes we need to address differently in health care. She says, "My eyes were forced wide open about the epidemic of undetected visual problems we have within this country.  I know we can do better as a society in addressing all the visual issues that affect both children and adults and I am committed to doing what I can to make a difference."

Central Washington school districts (Zillah, Orondo, and Ellensburg) and Educational Service District 105. She is a graduate of Seattle University Law School, sole practitioner with Hardison Law Offices, PLLC, 
located in Yakima, Washington. Her deep belief in the issues of social justice for the underserved, isolated, and disenfranchised brought her to Heritage University in Toppenish, Washington seven years ago. She is currently serving as the 
Associate Dean for the College of Education and Psychology and professor for school law, organizational ethics, essential leadership skills, and development of professional skills.
Her interest in the issues of adequate and affordable vision care for students and adults can be described as, “The issue is of paramount importance for children, incarcerated adults, and others 
whose inability to read has become a life-long burden preventing full realization of potential of all those afflicted.”
